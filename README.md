# BlasterTS
2-Bit Blaster written in TypeScript

The history of this game is that it originally started off written in JavaScript as part of a personal goal to learn more about JavaScript, gulp and Browerserify, and also to fulfill a long-held goal of writing a classic arcade shoot'em up style game.  When the XBox One was initially opened to individual developers, I stopped working on that project and decided to entirely rewrite it in C# to run as a UWP application.  Then came my desire to learn more about TypeScript and Webpack, and so I went back to the original JavaScript version to port it, and this is the result.  It's been a fun learning experience with all of the technologies that have been involved!
